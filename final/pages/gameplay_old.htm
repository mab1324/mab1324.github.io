          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p><i>Infinite Alice</i> is a <b>player-versus-player RPG horror</b> game,
          where two players race to complete stages while interfering with each other's progress.</p>
          <p>In this game, the main obstacles are puzzles and the stages themselves,
            as well as the enemies created by the players' <b>spirits</b>.</p>
          <p>There aren't any lives, and you can die as many times and you like, but beware â€”
            in addition to losing progress, you'll get a <b>time</b> penalty.</p>
          <p>You win if you complete the stage first, or if your opponent runs out of time.</p>
          <p>With one of seven(?) pairs of heroine and spirit, climb Castle Phantasmagoria
            and discover the truth!</p>
