          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p><i>Infinite Alice</i> is a <b>player-versus-player split-screen RPG horror game</b>,
          where two players race to complete floors while interfering with each other's progress.</p>
          <p>In this game, the main obstacles are puzzles and the stages themselves,
            as well as the various enemies created by the players' <b>spirits</b>.</p>
          <p>There aren't any lives, and you can die as many times as you like, but beware;
          aside from losing progress, you'll get a <b>time</b> penalty.</p>
          <p>The first person to complete the stage wins. Alternatively, the first player
            to run out of time loses.</p>
          <p>With one of seven(?) pairs of survivor and spirit, scale Castle Phantasmagoria
            and discover the truth!</p>
