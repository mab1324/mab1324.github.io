            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Marie's only friend, as well as her “familiar”. Their souls are
              tied in such a way that Prinn’s existence depends on her.</p>
            <p>Originally, she was a normal-ish human, but that was before she
              decided to participate in the same experiment Marie did.</p>
            <p>As they travelled across the dreamscape, they somehow kept
              running into each other, and even as the others died around
              them, Marie and Prinn remained… up until the very end, that is.</p>
            <p>The Memory they found at the end of dreaming was something far,
              far beyond the reach of humans.</p>
            <p>Despite knowing that, Prinn wanted to grasp it — </p>

            <h4>Bring the darkness of dreams to reality</h4>
            <p>Prinn wields an eldritch power that incarnates nightmares, fears,
              and other bad thoughts into monstrous forms.</p>
            <p>It seems this magic is handed down in her family, but just what
              kind of family can do that…?</p>

            <h3>Level 1 Enemy: Unease</h3>
            <p>An vague-looking insect. It hardly does any damage and goes away
              as soon as you attack it, so it's nothing but annoying.</p>
            <p>Just don't ignore it. They tend to swarm.</p>

            <h3>Level 2 Enemy: Anxiety</h3>
            <p>An unidentifiable spider monster.</p>
            <p>At first, it seems perfectly inert, just standing there and doing
              nothing, but under certain conditions, they'll suddenly attack.</p>
            <p>They're about as spontaneous as spiders in real life. All-around horrible.</p>

            <h3>Level 3 Enemy: Paranoia</h3>
            <p>A chaotic thing that looks somewhere between a slime and a starfish.</p>
            <p>They can go straight through the walls to attack, and have a habit of popping in out of nowhere.</p>
            <p>They're a bit hard to get rid of, but not that hard to dodge, so
              you might be inclined to ignore them for a while. But that's when they get really dangerous.</p>

            <h3>Boss Enemy: Terror</h3>
            <p>Prinn's trump card, a giant monster with killer tentacles straight
              from the weird horror genre.</p>
            <p>It's basically a super-Paranoia. It goes through walls, pops up
              out of nowhere whenever you outrun it, and it does crazy damage if it hits you.</p>
            <p>It also spawns more enemies, which can turn unmanageable in a matter of minutes.</p>
            <p>How to deal with it depends on the situation, but it should be done ASAP.</p>
