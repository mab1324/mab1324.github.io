            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>An eternally sleepy girl with an otherworldly aura. She only
              wears pajamas whether she's indoors or not.</p>
            <p>She was one of 20 participants in a secret experiment,
              which sought to reach other worlds through dreams.</p>
              <p>It seemed to be going well at first, but it suddenly went south,
                and by the time it was over, she and Prinn were the only survivors.</p>
            <p>Neither of them minded that much, though. There were
              <i>more important things</i> to worry about.</p>
            <p>What they discovered in those dreams, was something no human could imagine…</p>

            <h2>Features</h2>
            <h4>Switch between abilities using Memories</h4>
            <p>The Memories Marie acquired from the dreamscape give her a wide
              and eclectic range of abilities.</p>
            <p>She may look sleepy, but she's a character who excels in clearing stages at
              a high speed, suited to those who like running around and reacting
              to things on the spot.</p>

            <h3>Special A: Umbrella</h3>
            <p>A reliable umbrella. Surprisingly, it's Marie's signature weapon,
              but instead of hitting enemies with it, she just splashes them with water.
              It works, one way or another.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, its range is short, so it's probably better for
              Marie to avoid enemies altogether.</p>

            <h3>Special B: Cat Ears</h3>
            <p>A pair of ears and a tail. Apparently, they're real, and they
              make Marie move at superhuman speeds.</p>
            <p>The problem is the stamina cost. It's not much more effective
              than running normally, but it's great if you need to get away in a pinch.</p>

            <h3>Special X: Pajamas</h3>
            <p>Marie's favorite pajamas. By standing still in them, she quickly regains stamina.</p>
            <p>Maybe sleeping on her feet makes her stronger…?</p>

            <h3>Special Y: Ghost</h3>
            <p>Marie takes the appearance of a ghost. It looks like a Halloween
              costume, but as long as Marie's wearing it, it's the real deal.</p>
            <p>It causes her to move slower, but in exchange, she can slip past
              enemies, obstacles, and so on without a problem.</p>
            <p>It's almost cheating, really, but you have to watch out for the
              stamina cost when moving through things.</p>
