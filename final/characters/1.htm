            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>A girl who fell down a rabbit hole and entered the Land of the Lost,
              where the souls of discarded items gather.</p>
            <p>Since everyone there was hostile to humans, it was near-death
              experience after near-death experience, but…</p>
            <p>“We’re all friends now, so it’s fine!”</p>

            <h4>Wield the versatile power of magic books</h4>
            <p>As a magic user, Auretta is an all-around character who's good at everything.</p>
            <p>She carries with her a Thunder Tome, a Wind Tome, a Fire Tome, and
              a Plant Tome. Use them wisely, and you can turn any situation to your advantage.</p>

            <h3>Special A: Fire Tome</h3>
            <p>A book containing a spell for hurling fire.</p>
            <p>It can be used to attack enemies and destroy obstacles from a
              distance. With its high rate of fire, spamming it is encouraged.</p>
            <p>It's an unusually strong option for someone like Auretta,
            but maybe that's the difference between an ordinary human and a magic user.</p>

            <h3>Special B: Wind Tome</h3>
            <p>A book containing a spell to summon powerful winds.</p>
            <p>You can create stationary gusts of wind that send whoever touches
              them flying in a certain direction. Literally sow the wind and reap the whirlwind.</p>
            <p>Use it both to enhance your movement and hinder your opponents.</p>

            <h3>Special X: Thunder Tome</h3>
            <p>A book containing a stunning spell.</p>
            <p>With this, Auretta can place an invisible trap that stops her opponents
            for a few seconds. One isn't a big deal, but a bunch of them in
            one place is a real nuisance.</p>
            <p>Luckily for those who have to deal with these things, they're easy to destroy,
              but you'll also have to pay attention to the other screen to know where they are.</p>

            <h3>Special Y: Plant Tome</h3>
            <p>A book containing a spell for instant plant growth.</p>
            <p>It forms a tough barrier out of thorny vines. Use it to block passages
            and shield against enemy attacks.</p>
