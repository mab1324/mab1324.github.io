            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>A strange person who likes hunting for monsters, ghosts, and
              other things that go bump in the night.</p>
            <p>She’s always thought those kinds of beings were fascinating, and
              when some of her friends decided to break into a haunted house, she gladly came along.</p>
            <p>As it turned out, the house really was haunted, and everyone
              almost died from it — but that didn’t stop her from wanting to
              visit more of them.</p>
            <p>Armed with the mystical knowledge of her ancestors, she came
              across all kinds of yōkai, and made records of them while overcoming their attacks.</p>
            <p>Then, one night, she met the bake-danuki who would become her greatest enemy…</p>

            <h4>Use ritual arts to stop evil in its tracks</h4>
            <p>As a well-read occultist and the descendant of a family of onmyōji, Hikari knows a lot of ways to deal with supernatural pests.</p>
            <p>She doesn't have any special movement options, but it might be a fair trade for the ability to trivialize enemies.</p>

            <h3>Special A: Daoist's Bokutō</h3>
            <p>A wooden sword that emits bursts of spiritual power when swung.</p>
            <p>It's easy to swing and deadly for monsters. Use it to get rid of anything that stands in your way.</p>

            <p>An annoying piece of paper that prevents people from walking past it.</p>
            <p>It's not hard to remove, but players and enemies alike might not notice until they've run into it.</p>

            <h3>Special X: Nazar</h3>
            <p>A powerful talisman that stuns every enemy around Hikari. Something like an ultimate defense.</p>
            <p>The stamina cost is per enemy, so be wary of using it on too many enemies at once. That said, it's meant to be used in situations where the number of enemies is a problem.</p>

            <p>A paper doll that turns into a perfect replica of Hikari. If it's closer, enemies will target the replica instead of Hikari. A fantastic tool for getaways.</p>
