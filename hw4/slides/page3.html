	<i>The Game: The Game</i> is a dating simulator-style visual novel in which the player navigates through a series of confrontations with pick-up artists at a bar. It is the culmination of Angela Washko's research into the pick-up artist/seduction community, reproducing real strategies used and taught by pick-up artists. It is <a href="https://thegamethegame.org/">downloadable</a> and was presented as an installation at the Museum of the Moving Image in early 2018.
