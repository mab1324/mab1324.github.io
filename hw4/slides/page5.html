	<ul>
		<li>We both agreed that the game was very shocking.</li>
        <li>A lot of the interations with men in the game were creepy and too pushy. We didn't think that it could be this bad and were shocked at how rude and disrespectful the guys were being.</li>
        <li>We were questioning why the guys were unable to read the hints and 
        signals. Could some men be so dillusional and full of ego that they 
        can't even accept a no?</li>
        <li>We got really tired at some point of rejecting the guys we even considered playing along becuase it was getting so boring. This is what's really scary. That it's not their seduction that is working, but the fact that there is just no way to say no.</li>
        <li>For some reason we never considered fully going along with any of the guys. And none of the interactions escalated into anything beyond chats in the bar.</li>
		<li>At some point we all got so tired of the same repetitive interactions 
        that we just wanted to go home.</li>
        <li>We were so exhausted of these appalling interactions that we just went back to our place in the game instead of going to the mansion or trying again.</li>
