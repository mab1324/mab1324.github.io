    <div id="titleBox">What we thought of The Game</div>
    </div>
    <div class="text">We both agreed that the game 
        was very shocking.
        A lot of the interations with men in the game were creepy
        and too pushy. 
        We didn't think that it could be this bad and were shocked at 
        how rude and disrespectful the guys were being.
        We were questioning why the guys were unable to read the hints and 
        signals.
        Could some men be so dillusional and full of ego that they 
        can't even accept a no?
        We got really tired at some point of rejecting the guys we
        even considered playing along becuase it was getting so boring.
        This is what's really scary.
        That it's not their seduction that is working, but the fact is that 
        there is just no way to say no. 
        At some point we all got so tired of the same repetitive interactions 
        that we just wanted to go home.
        For some reason we never considered fully goign along with any of the guys.
        And none of the interactions escelated in anything 
        beyond the chats in the bar.
        We were so exhausted of these appaling interactions that we just 
        to go back to our place in the game.
