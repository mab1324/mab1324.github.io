      <p>I will be clear from the beginning: "Yoshi in Mario Party 10" is an indisputable masterpiece of character design and portrait art, and indeed, no one disputes it. Frankly, this review is not an attempt to criticize a piece; here, I will simply attempt to explain <i>why</i> this work is so enchanting.</p>
      <p>The eyes are first drawn to Yoshi's open smile, expressing freedom and leisurely joy. His pose suggests his mastery of nature, powerfully tromping with thick, orange shoes through wildlands and flower fields alike. Considered together, he is joyful, unshackled by the human concept of exaggeration. His gaze is almost wise, and his bright green contrasted with white works in harmony with his round, duck-like figure to form perhaps the most perfect embodiment of goodwill seen in this field, rivaled only by another famous Nintendo design, Kirby.</p>
      <p>The feat of creation Yoshi represents is awe-inspiring, and his many portraits have only accentuated this. This most recent portrait from Nintendo has become immediately symbolic, reinterpretations drawing on the suggestion of free-spirited mischief to proclaim Yoshi as a force of smirking, yet lovable chaos, whose primary crime is tax fraud — that is, the evasion of authority — a resurging of the mythological trickster figure in memetic guise. This fascinating trend exemplifies the power inherent in the design, and it seems certain that the portraits of Yoshi will continue to captivate audiences for years to come.</p>
